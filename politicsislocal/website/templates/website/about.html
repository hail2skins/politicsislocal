                                    It's no secret money helps drive the political process. On a national level there are large donors and PACs. These groups, 
                                    and the campaigns they support, have a wealth of historical donor data to help them identify potential contributors and target
                                    their fundraising efforts.

                                    On a local level, it's a different story. Most candidates for school board, city council, or mayor don't have access to the same
                                    resources and wealth of data. This makes the prospect of getting involved to help your community thorugh political office daunting.
                                    It's a barrier to entry that we aim to help lower.
