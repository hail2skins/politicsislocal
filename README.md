## Home of [Politics Is Local](https://politicsislocal.org) (NOT RUNNING YET)

Having run for a local office in Minnesota (school board) one challenge was fundraising. Most donors at this level are friends and family. 
Identifying ways to inspire voters to potentially contribute is difficult given the office is low profile and you have limited history and 
visibility into voting patterns.

**Higher level** offices like Senate and Governor have a wealth of voter data. A history of previous campaign contributions over time and have 
the money and staff to quickly identify people likely to help out. Local campaigns for mayor, school board, city council and the like lack these
systemic advantages.

This site hopes to provide a small measure of improvement to this reality.

We will gather public records, starting in our home state of Minnesota, and parse those records. We'll give potential candidates the ability
to identify donors likely to have similar beliefs (political affiliation) who may live within their zip code area of candidacy. This is a
site we anticipate monetizing, but if a candidate for local office can find a list of a dozen people who are their neighbors to door knock and 
pitch themselves and ask for money, maybe it'll help the process to avoid some financial imbalances one might see.
